In my previous [guide](content/3D Printing/Filament Calibration/index.md), it ran through how to configure a filament using OrcaSlicer.
Whilst this is good for hobbyist printers such as a printer like my personal Ender3v2, it is something that does not necessarily work on all printers.
Cura is the most commonly used slicer that is not behind a firewall, however for printers that I run at the University, they use a different slicing software.
Therefore, this guide will dive into how to configure a 3D printer with IdeaMaker, using the Raise3D Pro 2 printer.

# 3D printer calibration steps

## Flow rate calibration

## Temperature calibration

## Retraction calibration

# Fine tuning

## Top and bottom layer flow rate

## X and Y compensation

## Fix hole dimensions

## Z seam calibration

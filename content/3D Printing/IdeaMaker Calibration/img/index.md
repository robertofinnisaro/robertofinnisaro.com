In my previous [guide](content/3D Printing/Filament Calibration/index.md), it ran through how to configure a filament using OrcaSlicer.
Whilst this is good for hobbyist printers such as a printer like my personal Ender3v2, it is something that does not necessarily work on all printers.
Cura is the most commonly used slicer that is not behind a firewall, however for printers that I run at the University, they use a different slicing software.
Therefore, this guide will dive into how to configure a 3D printer with IdeaMaker, using the Raise3D Pro 2 printer.

# 3D printer calibration steps 

## Extruder calibration
One of the first steps that has been neglected thus far in my other guides is the calibration of the extruder. 
A full guide on how to calibrate this will be posted soon.

Calibrating the extruder is one of the most important aspects of 3D printing asn something that I find myself doing on a regular basis.
By calibrating the extruder, it ensures that the amount of filament requested by the printer is the same amount of filament extruded.

Once the extruder has been calibrated, ender the value into your filament profile in IdeaMaker.

This can be found under `Printer settings -> Advacned -> Step-E per MM`

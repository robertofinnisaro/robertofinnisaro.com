When a new filament arrives, don't just dive straight into printing with the filament.
It may be tempting to do this but all filaments act differently and a good print calibration can improve your print quality.
This process can take a while, but it will overall increase your productivity when 3D printing.

For this process, OrcaSlicer has great in-built tools that can be used to fine tune your printer for a new filament calibration.
There are multiple options in OrcaSlicer's calibration menu and this guide will look into how they work and how they can be used to calibrate a filament.

# OrcaSlicer Calibration Menu

The OrcaSlicer calibration menu is built directly into the slicer.
Below are the current options that are available.

- Temperature Tower
- Flow Rate
- Pressure Advance
- Tolerance Test
- Max (Volumetric) Flow Rate
- Vertical Fine Artifacts
- Retraction Test

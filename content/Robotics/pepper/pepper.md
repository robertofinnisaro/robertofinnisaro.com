## Pepper Start Up

To start up pepper, first make sure that pepper is in an open environment and on a flat surface.
On boot, pepper will check its surrounding area to ensure that the area that around it is safe to operate in.

To initiate peppers boot sequence, press the chest button once.

The LEDs on pepper will then begin to start blinking and fading which shows where pepper is up to in the boot sequence.
The boot process is completed when pepper says `"OGNAK GNOUK"`.

Pepper is now booted and applications can be run either automatically or interactively now.

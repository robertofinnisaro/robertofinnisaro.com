## Introduction
This is a tutorial on how to create an open day style program for Pepper using Choregraphe. Pepper has unique capabilities that make it an ideal companion for events such as a University Open Day. It provides an interactive and memorable experience for visitors. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating dynamic behaviour that showcases some of Pepper's features and functions, how to make it interact with attendees and how it can leave a lasting impression on visitors.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, there are some prerequisites that need to be completed. To accomplish this, ensure that you have the following:

1. A Pepper robot with Choregraphe software installed.
2. A basic familiarity with the Choregraphe interface.
3. A basic understanding on how Pepper operates and general knowledge on how to use Pepper safely.

## Open Choregraphe
The first step is to open Choregraphe, for this find and locate the application and launch it.
After the application has been opened, connect to your Pepper by entering the IP address.
To find the IP address, press the chest button on Pepper once and it will announce the IP address.

## Create a New Project
Once Pepper has been connected, the next step is to create a new project for your open day project.
For this, go to `File` > `New Project`.

Name your project with a suitable name: i.e `OpenDay` and choose a suitable location for the project to be saved in.

## Design the Open Day program
### Welcome Interaction
In the `Box Libraries` find the predefined `Animated Say` block located in `Speech` > `Creation` > `Animated Say`.

Double click on the box to edit some of the functionality. It is recommended to turn the speech speed down to 90%. This is also where you can enter a friendly welcome message to greet the visitors. 

You could implement a `Say` box here but `Animated Say` builds a more engaging welcome.

### Entertainment
Pepper has a built in tablet that can be used to for interaction. On of the interactions that can be used is displaying mp4 files. 

To use the tablet, find the `Show Image` box located in `Multimedia` > `Tablet` > `Show Image`. 

One of the videos that can be used in this section is an OpenDay video from your marketing team, download the video and place it in your project files and it will be able to be referenced through to the `Show Image` box. 

This feature can be integrated with `Animated Say` to better entertain visitors.
